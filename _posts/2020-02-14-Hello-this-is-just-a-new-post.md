Hi Hi  this is just a new posts
My workflow

test a
We face danger, we face evil, which stands at the gate of our most holy sanctuary.
God is with us, as we know.
God's love is eternal.
This we know too.

Tonight, in our most deadly hour do we think our God will remember us?
Will he reach down and save us from death's shadow?
No.
No, he will not.
Where in our world is God to be found? In our prayer?
No.
In our song?
No.
In our suffering, in our endurance?
No.

Faith is not a transaction.

You do not barter with the infinite.
You align with it.

So, then, where do we find our God? Sisters, I will tell you.

When you stand in the deepest pit, alone, without hope or help, and yet still know right from wrong When there is only darkness and despair and yet you feel humming in your blood, the difference between good and bad When you are beyond rescue or reward or judgment .
And you still look evil in the face and say, "No! "This far but no further.

"No!" Whose voice is that who is with you in that darkness?

Whose voice keeps you to the path?

Darkness and evil may seem compelling to us all, and I believe it is because, in their presence, we can feel God in our hearts.

No, he will not reach down to save us.

We will rise to meet him.

Let us pray.
